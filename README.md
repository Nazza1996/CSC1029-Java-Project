# 👋 Introduction
In the first year of my Computer Science degree, I completed a module on Object-Oriented Programming where I was tasked to individually develop a program for a fictional QUB photography department. This program organises a collection of images across a range genres to create and display albums.

## ☑️ Requirements
The program must include the following features:
- **Add Image:** The user must be able to add images
- **Search:** The user must be able to search through all images by any of its sub-options such as *title, description and genre*
- **Display All:** All images can be dynamically displayed
- **Exit:** The user must be able to exit the system

## 🏃‍♂️‍➡️ Running
1. Download the source code.
2. Import the code into a new Java project.
3. Inside the `src` folder there is two folders, `part01` and `part02`.

    - `part01` uses the IDE integrated console by running `QUBImages.java`, no images will be displayed.
    - `part02` uses the external console by running `QUBMediaImages.java`, this version will display images.
